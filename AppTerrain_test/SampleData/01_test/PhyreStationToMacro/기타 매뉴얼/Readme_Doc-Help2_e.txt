Installation Instructions for Help 2 Documentation
======================================================================
The Help 2 format allows you to browse the PhyreEngine(TM)
documentation from within the Visual Studio integrated development
environment.

To see and use this Help 2 documentation, you must register it with
Visual Studio.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing and Registering the Documentation
----------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: If you use the PhyreEngine(TM) installer software to download
the Help 2 documentation, installation and registration of the Help 2
documentation should occur automatically during the installation 
process. Follow the steps below only if you downloaded the Help 2 
package manually. This process will copy the necessary Help 2 files 
into \Program Files\SCE\Help2Docs and then register them with Visual
Studio.

To install and register the documentation:

1. Make sure that the Visual Studio application is not running.

2. Browse to the file 
"docs\en\help2\Install_PhyreEngine_Help2_Documentation_e.bat"
included in this package.

3. Double-click on that file to launch the installation and
registration application.

4. When the application completes, launch the Visual Studio
application. Visual Studio will take up to several minutes to 
integrate the Help 2 documentation the first time it is launched
after registration. After this first time, Visual Studio should
launch in the normal amount of time.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Un-Installing and Un-Registering the Documentation
----------------------------------------------------------------------
To remove the PhyreEngine(TM) Help 2 documentation from the Visual 
Studio integrated development environment, you must un-register it 
with Visual Studio in addition to removing the Help 2 files from your
system.

NOTE: If you use the PhyreEngine(TM) installer software to un-install
the Help 2 documentation, un-installation and un-registration of the
Help 2 documentation should occur automatically during the
un-installation process. Follow the steps below only if you remove
the Help 2 package manually.
If you have discarded the folder containing the 
UnInstall_PhyreEngine_Help2_Documentation_e.bat file, download the 
entire Help 2 package from the PS3 Developer Network and use the 
UnInstall_PhyreEngine_Help2_Documentation_e.bat file from that
package. 

To un-install and un-register the documentation:

1. Make sure that the Visual Studio application is not running.

2. Browse to the file 
"docs\en\help2\UnInstall_PhyreEngine_Help2_Documentation_e.bat"
included in this package.

3. Double-click on that file to launch the installation and
registration application.

4. When the application completes, launch the Visual Studio 
application. Visual Studio will take up to several minutes to adjust
the Help 2 documentation the first time it is launched after

in the normal amount of time.
